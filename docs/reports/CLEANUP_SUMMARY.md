## 🔄 Ongoing Organization

### When to Archive
Move to `docs/archive/` when:
- ✅ Work is completed
- ✅ No longer actively referenced
- ✅ Superseded by new documentation

### What to Keep in Root
Only keep in root when:
- ✅ Actively maintained
- ✅ Required for submission (Privacy/Terms)
- ✅ Critical current information
- ✅ First thing developers should see

### Regular Cleanup
Recommended schedule:
- 📅 **Weekly**: Review root for new clutter
- 📅 **Monthly**: Archive completed work docs
- 📅 **Quarterly**: Clean up docs/ subdirectories

---

## ✨ Result

**Your project is now professionally organized and App Store ready!**

- Clean, uncluttered root directory
- Logical documentation structure
- All historical work preserved
- Easy to navigate for new developers
- Professional appearance for reviewers

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Keep root clean** - Don't add new docs to root unless essential
2. ✅ **Use docs/ folders** - Put new docs in appropriate subdirectory
3. ✅ **Archive regularly** - Move completed work to archive
4. ✅ **(Optional) Archive CLEANUP_PLAN.md** - Can move to docs/ once reviewed

## Files You Can Archive Later

Once you've reviewed this cleanup:
- `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` → Can move to `docs/archive/`

This keeps root directory at just 5 essential files.
